# NLP-Classification_VectorSpaces
Code for the course "Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces"
*(Audit Course)*

Codes are based on the topics shown in the video; however, these do not match the same techniques shown in the videos.

For example, I used Pandas and Scikit-learn while they used raw methods.

- 01_Preprocessing.ipynb

    All steps of preprocessing dataset
    
- 02_logistic_regression.ipynb (Polarity)

    After the preprocessing of data, how to build matrices that can be used as features.
    
    Feature extraction with countvectorizer, tf-idf vectorizer
    
    Finally, apply logistic regression. I used Scikit-Learn
